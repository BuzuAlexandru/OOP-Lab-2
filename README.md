##Simulation of a tower defense game.

For this simulation I defined the following entities:
*Map - made up of tiles.
*Tile - can be either terrain, road, building spot, enemy entrance portal, finish line for enemies.
*Soldier - stationary NPC with several stats that either operates a tower of fights on the ground.
*Enemy - mobile NPC with several stats that can do dmg to the player.
*Weapon - equipment for NPCs with several stats.
*Ammo - additional equipment for ranged weapons with several stats.
*Trap - a stationary entity that can be placed on road tiles to dmg or slow enemies.
*Tower - building managed by the player and operated by a soldier to deal ranged dmg.
*Barracks - a tower where soldiers on the ground spawn.
*Player - class to keep track of coins and health of player during simulation.
